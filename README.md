# What is Cats Facts Masters?

A trivia game played in your web browser. There are 11 True/False questions that will appear one at a time, in a random order. The player has 15 seconds per question, and the same amount of time again to read a little tidbit about the correct answer after their choice. A final score will be displayed at the end.

There were a few last minute tweaks to the game to give the user more time to chose and read answers. There may be a few bugs around as well, due to the rushed development of the trivia game.

## How the game was made

This game is made with HTML and css to display to the browser, and JavaScript with some jQuery to handle the game logic.
