// When the DOM loads....
// Show the title screen, and offer pressing anywhere on the screen to start the game
// When clicked, game starts
// The first question appears, and the timer starts
// User has 10s to select an answer by clicking on it
//-----> if correct, add to their correct answers count
//-----> show the correct answer + some extra explanation
// At the end of the 10 questions quiz, show player their score and congratulate.
// Offer to restart the game by pressing a "start over" button

// Maybe make each question an object, and have them be added to an array?
// Remove object when it has been used, and so that it cannot be called a second time
